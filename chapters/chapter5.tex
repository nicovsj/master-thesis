To evaluate REQL, we compile logical VA into so-called \emph{extended VA}, a
``physical'' automata model closer to the evaluation algorithm than to the query
language. We use this model for the REQL evaluation algorithm used in \rematch,
which makes one pass over the document and produces the resulting mappings with
output-linear delay. This evaluation algorithm refines and improves the
theoretical algorithm presented in \citep{FlorenzanoRUVV20} for evaluating
extended VA by taking care of the memory usage, simplifying the algorithm, and
applying various optimizations presented in the previous sections.    

\section{Extended VA}

An \emph{extended variable-set automaton} (\(\EVA\))~\citep{FaginKRV15} is a
finite-state automaton extended with capture variables in a way analogous to
logical VA. The difference is that reading and outputting variable markers can
be done in a single transition\footnote{The name $\EVA$ is also used
by~\citep{FlorenzanoRUVV20} for an automaton model outputting sets of markers.
However, the eVA of~\citep{FlorenzanoRUVV20} require letter and variable
transitions to be separate, while we process them simultaneously. We use the
same name for consistency.}  
%This extension will considerably simplify the algorithm and justify the use of
%a new model, more closed to the evaluation strategy than to the REQL query.
Formally, an $\EVA$ $\cE$ is a tuple \((Q, q_0, F, \delta)\), where \(Q\) is a
finite set of \textit{states}; $q_0 \in Q$ is the initial state; $F\subseteq Q$
is the set of final states; and $\delta$ is a \textit{transition relation}
consisting of transitions of the form $(q, a, S, q')$ where $q, q' \in Q$, $a
\in \Sigma \cup \{\osymbol\}$, and $S$ is a set of variable markers (e.g.,
$S=\{\Open{x},\Close{y}\}$). The meaning behind the transition $(q, a, S, q')$
is that when the automaton is in the state $q$ and reads the $i$-th letter $a_i
= a$, then it switches to state $q'$ and outputs $(S, i)$, where $S$ is the set
of variables that are opened and closed \emph{before} reading the $i$-th letter.
In particular, when $S = \emptyset$, the automaton changes the state and nothing
is output.
%Note that the special symbol $\osymbol$ is used to simulate opening variables
%before reading the first letter of the document. We define the set $\Var(\cE)$
%as the set of all variables $x$ that are mentioned in some transition of $\cE$.

The fact that a transition can open or close multiple variables at the same time
	allows us to handle nested variables (e.g. \texttt{!x\{!y\{a\}\}}) in a
	single automaton transition. Furthermore, the $\osymbol$ symbol is used as a
	special input to denote the end of a document (i.e., an End Of File, or
	\texttt{EOF}). This will be useful in the run of an $\EVA$ for outputting
	spans $[i, j\rangle$ over a document of size $n$, where $i$ and $j$ range
	from $0$ to $n$ (i.e., we need $n+1$ possible positions).

Next we define how an $\EVA$ produces outputs. A \emph{run} $\rho$ of $\cE$ over
a document $d = a_0 \cdots a_{n-1}$ is a sequence of the form:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:run}
	\rho \ = \ q_0 \ \longtrans{b_0 / S_0} \ q_1 \ \longtrans{b_1 / S_1} \ q_2 \ \longtrans{b_2 / S_2} \ \ldots \ \ q_{n} \longtrans{b_{n} / S_n} \ q_{n+1}
\end{equation}
where $b_0 b_1 \ldots b_n = a_0 \ldots a_{n-1} \osymbol$, $S_j$ is a set of
variable markers, and $(q_j,b_{j},S_{j}, q_{j+1}) \in \delta$, for $0\leq j\leq
n$. Also, we say that $\rho$ is \emph{accepting} if $q_{n+1} \in F$. A run
$\rho$ like (\ref{eq:run}) naturally defines an output sequence as $\oout(\rho)
= \oout(S_0, 0) \cdot \ldots \cdot \oout(S_n, n)$ such that $\oout(S_i, i) =
(S_i, i)$ if $S_i \neq \emptyset$, and $\epsilon$, otherwise. Finally, the
semantics of $\cE$ over $d$, denoted by $\semseq{\cE}_d$, is defined as the set
of all output sequences $\oout(\rho)$ where $\rho$ is an accepting run of $\cE$
over $d$.

$\EVA$ has several differences compared to logical VA: (1) an $\EVA$ starts from
the beginning of the document, (2) produces output sequences instead of
mappings, and (3) the transitions are fired by symbols (i.e., not by char
classes). These relaxations plus read-captures transitions will considerably
simplify the evaluation algorithm.  Indeed, we can show that if we start from a
logical VA $\cA$, then we can construct an equivalent $\EVA$ $\cE$ in linear
time. %, for evaluating $\cA$.
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:eVAconstruction}
%	For every logical VA $\cA$ compiled from a REQL query, one can build in
%	linear time an $\EVA$ $\cE$ such that $\cE$ evaluated over a document $d$
%	produces the same output sequences of mappings from $\cA$ evaluated over
%	$d$.
	For every logical VA $\cA$ compiled from a REQL query \texttt{e}, one can
	build, in linear time, an $\EVA$ $\cE$ such that $\cE$ evaluated over a
	document $d$ produces precisely the output sequences representing the
	mappings in $\sem{\cA}_d = \sem{\texttt{e}}_d$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{example}\label{ex:lva-eva} To illustrate
	Proposition~\ref{prop:eVAconstruction}, recall query $\texttt{e0}$ and its
	equivalent logical VA $\cA_0$ from Example~\ref{example:logicalVA}. The

Here we draw an edge $q \ \longtrans{a / S} \ q'$ to denote a transition from
$q$ to~$q'$ that output $S$ when reading a letter $a$, and use $*$ to denote any
letter. Intuitively, we have moved transitions with variable markers ``forward''
if we compare $\cE_0$ with $\cA_0$.  For instance, $\cA_0$ had transitions $0
\trans{\Open{x}} 1 \trans{t} 2$, but instead $\cE_0$ has a  direct transition $0
\longtrans{t/\Open{x}} 1$.  Since an extended VA needs to consume the entire
document, we add self-loops in the initial and the final state; for instance $4
\longtrans{t/\Close{x}} 5$. Also note that the transition $0
\longtrans{*/\emptyset} 0$ closes the variable \texttt{x} before the character
(\textsf{EOF} or any other character) is consumed.
\end{example}

\section{Determinization} 
There is a critical issue with using $\EVA$ as our guide for evaluating REQL:
several runs can produce the same output sequence. To illustrate this issue in
its simplest form, assume the following extended VA $\cE_0'$, which is a mild
modification of $\cE_0$:

	\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth, semithick, auto, initial text= {}, initial distance= {3mm}, accepting distance= {4mm}, node distance=2.2cm, semithick]

			\node[state,accepting] (6) [right of=5] {$5$};
			
			\draw[->] (0) edge[loop above] node {$*/\emptyset$} (0); \draw[->]

			{$h/\emptyset$} (3); \draw[->] (3) edge node[pos=0.7]
			{$a/\emptyset$} (4); \draw[->] (4) edge node[pos=0.3]
			{$t/\emptyset$} (5); \draw[->] (3) edge node[swap,pos=0.7]

			(6); \draw[->] (6) edge[loop above] node {$*/\emptyset$} (6);		
		\end{scope}
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
One can check that $\cE_0'$ is equivalent to $\cE_0$, namely,
$\semseq{\cE_0'}(d) = \semseq{\cE_0}(d)$ for every document $d$. However, for
every output sequence of $\semseq{\cE_0'}(d)$, two different runs are witnessing
it: one crossing the state $3$ and another crossing the state $3'$. Then, if we
guide an evaluation algorithm of eVA with runs, for $\cE_0'$ we will enumerate
each output sequence twice, although the user expects to extract each output
without duplicates. Similar behavior can happen for eVAs coming from REQL
queries with quantifiers or alternations. 

To remove duplicate runs from $\EVA$, we use a subclass called
\emph{deterministic} $\EVA$. We say that an $\EVA$ $\cE$ is \emph{deterministic}
if its transition relation $\delta$ satisfies that for every two transitions
$(q, a_1, S_1, q_1') \in \delta$ and $(q, a_2, S_2, q_2') \in \delta$, if $(a_1,
S_1) = (a_2, S_2)$, then $q_1' = q_2'$. In other words, given a state $q$, the
next state is determined by the pair $(a, S)$. The reader can check that $\cE_0$
is deterministic but $\cE_0'$ is not. 

A deterministic $\EVA$ ensures that for every document and output sequence,
there is at most one accepting run. This correspondence is crucial for our
evaluation algorithm, given that we can simulate runs and construct the output,
without worrying about duplicates. Fortunately, we can always ``determinize'' a
non-deterministic $\EVA$ $\cE = (Q, q_0, F, \delta)$ by using a subset
construction, similar to the standard determinization procedure for NFAs. More
precisely, we define $\cE^{\odet} = (Q^{\odet}, q_0^{\odet}, F^{\odet},
\delta^{\odet})$ such that: $Q^{\odet} = 2^Q$, $q_0^{\odet} = \{q_0\}$,
$F^{\odet} = \{X \mid X \cap F \neq \emptyset\}$, and:
$$
	\delta^{\odet} = \{(X, a, S, X') \mid \forall q' \in X'. \, \exists q \in X. \, (q, a, S, q') \in \delta\}.
$$
%\begin{align*} Q^{\odet} & = 2^Q \\
%q_0^{\odet} & = \{q_0\} \\
%F^{\odet} & = \{X \mid X \cap F \neq \emptyset\}; \text{ and} \\
%\delta^{\odet} & = \{(X, a, S, X') \mid \forall q' \in X'. \, \exists q \in X.
%\, (q, a, S, q') \in \delta\}. \end{align*} where $2^Q$ is the powerset of $Q$,
%namely, all subsets of $Q$.
One can check that $\cE$ and $\cE^{\odet}$ are equivalent (i.e., they define the
same output for every document), and that $\cE^{\odet}$ is deterministic.

An inconvenience of $\cE^{\odet}$ is that its size is exponential in $|\cE|$.
Fortunately, for the evaluation algorithm it is not necessary to construct
entire $\cE^{\odet}$. Instead, we can start from the initial set $\{q_0\}$ and
traverse only the transitions and states needed by the next letter. Each time
that we need a new state or transitions of $\cE^{\odet}$, we use $\cE$ to build
them and cache it in main memory for future access. This is the purpose of the
\emph{determinization module} of \rematch, called $\cdet$. Specifically, $\cdet$
has a method $\mdetnext$ such that, given a state $X \in Q^\odet$ and a letter
$a$, $\cdet.\mdetnext(X, a)$ computes a list $\ell$ with all pairs $(S, X')$
such that $(X,a,S,X') \in \delta^\odet$. Instead, if $\ell$ was already computed
before (and cached), $\cdet.\mdetnext(X, a)$ outputs $\ell$ immediately. Then by
using $\cdet$ we only need to compute each state and transition once. Moreover,
the number of states accessed by $\cdet$ depends on $\cE$ and the input document
$d$. In practice, this size is small and at most three or four times the size of
$\cE$.

\section{Algorithm's variables} 
In Algorithm~\ref{alg:evaluation} we present the main algorithm for \rematch.
This algorithm evaluates an $\EVA$ $\cE$ over the input document $d$,
enumerating all output sequences $\semseq{\cE}(d)$. %Next, we introduce the
variables and data structures used by the algorithm.
%
Two main components used by the algorithm are the node manager $\ds$, introduced
in Chapter~\ref{chpt:output}, and the determinization module $\cdet$, introduced
above. In addition, we use \emph{states-sets} constructed by $\cdet$,
\emph{set-lists} that store states-sets, and \emph{nodes} created and operated
by $\ds$. We introduced nodes $\coid$ in Chapter~\ref{chpt:output}. %Next, we
explain how states-sets and set-lists work.

The states-sets, denoted by $X$ in the algorithm, are built and cached by the
determinization module for representing a set $X \subseteq Q$. Each states-set
$X$ has two variables: $X.\coid$ and $X.\citer$. The former can store a node
that represents the current outputs of runs that reached $X$. Instead, the
latter is an integer that encodes the current phase number: if $X.\citer = i$
then the $i$-th iteration was the last one that reached $X$. In practice,
$\citer$ will help to know whether it is the first time we reached $X$ during
some iteration. Further, each states-set has a method $X.\texttt{isFinal}$ that
outputs $\texttt{TRUE}$ if, and only if, $X$ is a final set (i.e., $X \cap F
\neq \emptyset$). In the implementation, this is a flag that the determinization
module sets when creating $X$.

We will also use set-lists, denoted by $\cstateslists$ in the algorithm, which
are linked-list of states-sets. For this data structure, we assume a method
$\cstateslists.\texttt{clear}$ to empty the list,
$\cstateslists.\texttt{add}(X)$ to add $X$ at the end, and
$\cstateslists.\texttt{swap}(\cstateslists')$ to swap the content between two
lists. To iterate over each element $X$ in the list, we conveniently write
``$\textbf{for all} \ X \in \cstateslists$''. We assume any straightforward
implementation of set-list that takes constant time for each call to these
methods. Finally, during the algorithm, we use two set-lists variables,
$\cstateslists$, and $\cstateslists'$. We assume that $\cstateslists$,
$\cstateslists'$, $\ds$, and $\cdet$ can be globally accessed by all methods.

\section{Main algorithm}
The main method of Algorithm~\ref{alg:evaluation} is $\textproc{Evaluate}$,
which receives as input an $\EVA$ $\cE = (Q,\delta,q_0,F)$ and the document $b_0
\ldots b_{n}$. Recall that $b_0 \ldots b_{n-1}$ is the original document and
$b_n = \osymbol$ is the \texttt{EOF} symbol. The algorithm starts by
initializing the determinization module $\cdet$ with $\cE$ at line~$2$. The
\texttt{initialize} method is for storing $\cE$ inside $\cdet$ and using it
later during the determinization. Then we do the initialization of
$\cstateslists$ and $\cstateslists'$ by calling $\textproc{InitializeLists}$
(line 3). This method clears both lists (lines 15-16) and adds the state-set
$X_0$ to $\cstateslists$ (line 20). This state-set represents $\{q_0\}$, namely,
the determinization initial set. For this, $\cdet$ provides a method
$\cdet.\texttt{initialStateSet}$ that outputs $X_0 = \{q_0\}$ (line 17). Then we
initiate $X_0.\citer$ with $-1$ (line 18) and fill $X_0.\coid$ with the empty
output node (line 19). Intuitively, no iterations have accessed $X_0$ yet, and
the $\cE^{\odet}$-run at $X_0$ only has the empty output.

The evaluation algorithm processes the document $b_0 \ldots b_{n}$ symbol by
symbol, from $i=0$ to $n$ (line 4). During the $i$-th iteration, the
$\cstateslists$ keeps all state-sets $X$ that can be reached by runs reading
$b_0\ldots b_{i-1}$, and $X.\coid$ a node storing all outputs of these runs.
Instead, $\cstateslists'$ will contain the new state-sets after reading the new
letter $b_i$. Intuitively, to build $\cstateslists'$ from $\cstateslists$ we
fire all state-sets $X$ in $\cstateslists$ one-by-one (line 5) by calling the
method $\cdet.\texttt{next}(X,b_i)$ with symbol $b_i$ (line 6). As explained
previously, this method gives a list $\ell$ of pairs $(S, X')$, where there is a
transition $(X, b_i, S, X') \in \delta^{\odet}$. Then, if $(S, X') \in \ell$, we
must extend the output sequences in $X.\coid$ with $(S, i)$, and store them in
$X'$. We do this updating by calling the method
$\textproc{UpdateSets}(X,\ell,i)$ (line 8), discussed below. If the list $\ell$
is empty (e.g., $\cdet$ detects that by reading $b_i$ from $X$, there is no way
to continue), then we call the node manager $\ds$ and mark $X.\coid$ for the
garbage collection (line 10). Notice that, by using the determinization manager,
we can detect the right place to reuse memory in the algorithm. Finally, when we
end firing all state-sets in $\cstateslists$, we swap the two lists and clean
$\cstateslists'$ to start the iteration again (lines 11-12).

\section{Update method} 
The workhorse of the evaluation algorithm is $\textproc{UpdateSets}(X, \ell,i)$,
which is in charge of updating each state-set $X'$ by extending the outputs in
$X.\coid$ with $(S,i)$, for each $(S, X') \in \!\ell$. For this purpose, we
iterate over each $(S, X') \in \ell$, create a copy $\coid'$ of $X.\coid$, and
extend all output sequences in $\coid'$ with $(S,i)$ if $S\neq \emptyset$ (lines
28-30). Next, we need to update $X'.\coid$ depending on whether it is the first
time or not that we reach $X'$. For this, we use variable $X'.\citer$: if
$X'.\citer < i$, then we update $X'.\citer$ to $i$, add $X'$ to
$\cstateslists'$, and set $X'.\coid$ equal to $\coid'$ (lines 31-34). Otherwise,
it is not the first time that we reach $X'$, and we need to union the output
sequences in $X'.\coid$ with the ones in $\coid'$ (lines~35-36).

For the correctness of $\textproc{UpdateSets}$, we cannot reach any state-set
$X$ in two consecutive iterations (i.e., both in the $(i-1)$- and $i$-th
iteration for some $i$). Otherwise, we could use $X.\coid$ by reading and
updating it simultaneously, possibly erasing its content. For this reason,
during the rewriting module we duplicate the logical $\VA$, alternating between
even and odd positions. This construction forces that, at this stage, we cannot
reach any state-set $X$ in two consecutive iterations as needed.

$\textproc{UpdateSets}$ passes and updates the outputs from the $(i-1)$- to the
$i$-th layer, which is the heaviest part of the algorithm. Therefore, it is
crucial to perform $\textproc{UpdateSets}$ as efficiently as possible. For this,
we use linked-lists and $\citer$ variables, which allows us to check in a single
instruction whether $X'$ is already in $\cstateslists'$ or not. These tricks are
standard in the implementation of RegEx engines~\citep{cox2007regular}. The
novelty is then to incorporate these optimizations in a new evaluation algorithm
for computing all matches.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{figures/algo-run.tex}
	\caption{An example of how Algorithm~\ref{alg:evaluation} works.}
	\label{fig:algo-run}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}
	Figure~\ref{fig:algo-run} displays a graphic of how
Algorithm~\ref{alg:evaluation} would run with eVA $\cA_0$ from
Example~\ref{ex:lva-eva} and document $d_0$. Below document $d_0$, we draw as
columns the \cstateslistss{} that are computed after reading the corresponding
symbol. For this example, each state-set is a single state, and then each number
in a \cstateslists{} corresponds to a state in $\cA_0$. Below each state-set
$X$, we draw in grey the node $X.\coid$ from the ECS that the algorithm
construct. 
\end{example}

\section{Next index (Optimization)} 
A significant step for the evaluation algorithm is the call to the
$\cdet.\texttt{next}$ function (line 6). Given a state-set $X$ and a symbol
$b_i$, the first time that the algorithm calls $\cdet.\texttt{next}(X, b_i)$ the
$\cdet$ module must compute a list with all pairs $(S, X')$ such that it holds
that $(X,a,S,X') \in \delta^\odet$, and save it in its cache. Then, for later
calls to  $\cdet.\texttt{next}(X, b_i)$, the $\cdet$ module must quickly find
this list in the cache. The evaluation uses the $\cdet$'s cache multiple times,
making it  one of the heaviest parts of the computation. To decrease the load of
the algorithm, we add an index to each state set $X$, which quickly allows
finding the next state-set given a $b_i$. Currently, \rematch\ only supports
ASCII documents; therefore, we implement this index as an array with 128
entries. This array on each state-set allows us to quickly find the next
state-set, considerably improving the performance of the evaluation algorithm.
Here, for the next index, we are sacrificing space versus time. Of course, a
more compact next index (e.g., for non-ASCII documents) could save space during
the evaluation. We leave this for future work. 

\section{Enumeration} 
When we get to the end of the document, $\cstateslists$ contains all state-set
$X$ that can be reached by runs of $\cE^\odet$ when reading $b_0 \ldots b_n$. In
particular, $X.\coid$ has the node representing all outputs of these runs. Then
we call $\textproc{Enumerate}$ (line 13), which iterates over all $X \in
\cstateslists$ that are final, and enumerates the output sequences in $X.\coid$
by calling the enumerate method of the node manager (lines 23-25).
%
As described in Chapter~\ref{chpt:output}, we can perform an early output
enumeration whenever we reach a final state at the $i$-th iteration. For ease of
presentation, we code Algorithm~\ref{alg:evaluation} with the enumeration
procedure after reading the whole document. %Instead, in REmatch's
implementation, we call the enumeration method whenever we reach a final state.
