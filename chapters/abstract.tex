In this thesis, we present the \rematch\ system for information extraction.
\rematch\ is based on a recently proposed enumeration algorithm for evaluating
regular expressions with capture variables supporting the all-match semantics.
It tells a story of what it takes to make a theoretically optimal algorithm work
in practice. As we show here, a naive implementation of the original algorithm
would have a hard time dealing with realistic workloads. We thus develop a new
algorithm and a series of optimizations that make \rematch\ as fast as or faster
than many popular RegEx engines while at the same time being able to return all
the outputs, a task that most other engines tend to struggle with. \
