This thesis presents \rematch, a novel RegEx engine allowing to find all
matches. The reader can test the all-match semantics at our beta demo available
on \url{www.rematch.cl}. Such a semantics is relevant in areas like literature
or DNA analysis, where overlapping matches do matter. We experimentally prove
that although \rematch\ does a more demanding job, it does so with almost no
additional cost when compared to classical RegEx engines, making it a good
candidate for use cases where all matches are needed.  Finally, this thesis
presents the architecture, algorithms, and optimizations for capturing all
matches. However, we see plenty of room for new optimizations like state
reductions, filtering, or indices. We leave this for future work.
