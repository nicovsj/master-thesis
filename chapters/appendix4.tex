To construct an equivalent extended Variable Automaton (eVA) $\cE$ from a document $d$ and a logical VA $\cA = (Q, \delta, q_0, q_f)$ derived from a REQL query \texttt{e}, one can adopt a procedure akin to that for $\varepsilon$-logical VAs, as detailed in Appendix \ref{app:logicalVA}. This process begins by defining, for each state $q \in Q$, a \emph{variable-set closure}, $\vclosure(q)$. This closure encompasses all states that are accessible from $q$ solely through variable transitions. For any state $r$ within $\vclosure(q)$, a series of variable transitions must exist: $(r_0, o_0, r_1), \ldots, (r_n, o_n, r_{n+1})$, where $r_0 = q$, $r_{n+1} = r$, and each $o_i$ represents a variable marker for $0 \leq i \leq n$. Given $\cA$'s basis in a REQL query, the variable markers set $\{o_i \mid 0 \leq i \leq n\}$ remains consistent across all sequences leading to $r$. For each transition $(r, C, s) \in \delta$, where $C$ is a character class, a new transition $(q, a, \{o_i \mid 0 \leq i \leq n\}, s)$ is added to the updated transition relation $\delta'$ if and only if $a \in C$ and appears in $d$. Furthermore, if $r$ equals $q_f$, then $q$ should be included in $\cE$'s new accepting states set $F$. Lastly, for every transition of the form $(q, C, q')$, add $(q, a, \emptyset, q')$ to $\delta'$ iff $a \in C$ and appears in $d$. The resulting eVA $\cE = (Q, \delta', q_0, F)$ will satisfy $\sem{\cE}_d = \sem{\cA}_d$.
